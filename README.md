# Jets Project

# Description

This program uses abstract classes, extend, implement, and reading in a file to create an airfield with a list of jets at your disposal. The user is presented with a list of options to choose from to interact with the jets. For example the user could view the that are in the "hangar," view the fastest jet, or even add or remove a jet from the inventory. 

# What I learned
It is becoming easier to translate what needs to happen with actionable steps. This assignment was aided by the use of a UML diagram that helped structure and keep track of what needed to be done. The added exposure to constructors use of objects are helping to increase my understanding of how they work and how to identify solutions to problems when I come across them. I would have to say the use of try/catch would be my weakest point on this project. Added use and exposure would help deepen my understanding of what's going on and how to best implement error catching into future programs. Overall this was a good program to review previous concepts and structures that we learned and to brush up on those concepts that may not be recalled fully.
